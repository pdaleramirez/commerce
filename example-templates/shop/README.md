## Craft Commerce Example Templates

These templates are an example of all features available to the front end of your Commerce site.

This `shop/` folder can be copied to your project's `templates/` directory for testing and copying during development.

The templates use pure inline [tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes for all styling, making it easier to extract 
parts of the example templates for your own use.

All example javascript int the templates is written with zero external dependencies. We don't use jQuery or Vue.js but we do 
rely on modern browser APIs like [`fetch`](https://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch).

Other than tailwind classes, we have utility classes and IDs prepended with `js-` to
show they are to be used by javascript only.

If you rename the shop folder to something else, you will need to replace the string `shop` in all templates.
